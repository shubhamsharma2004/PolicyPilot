After building our AI assistant web app, we can connect it to WhatsApp securely by using the Meta WhatsApp Cloud API. We create a WhatsApp Business App in the Meta Developer Console, configure a webhook URL (pointing to our FastAPI backend), and verify it with a secure verify token. Whenever an employee sends a WhatsApp message, Meta forwards it to our backend through this webhook. The backend passes the question into our existing /ask function, generates an answer from the policy data, and sends the reply back to the employee using the WhatsApp Send API with a bearer access token. All sensitive tokens are stored in environment variables, communication happens over HTTPS, and only policy-based answers are returned. This way, employees can ask HR policy questions directly from WhatsApp in a secure and compliant manner.
